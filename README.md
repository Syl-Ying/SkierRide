- How to run client
  - Run the main() in SkierClient class.
- Where to change the Servlet URL
  - Change URL in SERVER_URL variable of HttpPostThread class.
- Where to find servlet war file to deploy on EC2
  - SkierRide/out/artifacts/Server_war/Server_war.war
- Future Improvements
  - Catch exception and writeResponse in doPost() of servlet, explicitly throw exceptions in helper methods
  - Fix POST servlet load balancer
  - Add destroy() in servlet to close channel poll and connection
  - Queue sharding + increase rate limiting qps -> increase client rqs
    - Partition the producer's workload. Tasks with skierID â‰¤ 5000 go to Queue 1. Tasks with skierID > 5000 go to Queue 2.
    - In case messages in the primary queue cannot be processed within a certain time, redirect them to a DLQ
  - Centralized Config server
